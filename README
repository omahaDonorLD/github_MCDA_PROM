The application is much more easier to compile with the Make tool. The Make tool does the whole building process and provides a complete, ready to use executable (a gcc compiler is also required).

For users with no "make" tool available, a solution could be to rebuild completely from the sources, or for windows users, install the mingw and msys (http://www.mingw.org/) tools that provide all the necessary (make and a gcc compiler).


The general procedures to know are the following :
	a) The "Make" command produces the executable "MCDA" and,
	b) to run the application, a numerical instance of a MCDA problem (stochastic or deterministic) is required as parameter (some instances are present in the "data" directory) :
		eg: to apply PROMETHEE on the numerical instance given by "data1" file (into ./data/) with a deterministic method :
			./MCDA 0 0 ./data/data1
			* The digit 0 as 2nd argument, tells the application to use PROMETHEE with a usual method and not the stochastic version. To run the application using the EPF (Expected Preference Function), for a stochastic multicriteria problem whose joint distribution is not known, just change the digit provided as argument to 1.
			* The digit 0 as 3rd argument tells the application to use the PROMETHEE 1 outranking method (set to 1 if a complete ranking is needed (PROMETHEE II).)
	c) When the number of arguments provided are more than 4, the default operation is to apply a sorting as well (flowsort method). The 5th provided argument is the file of reference profiles :
		./MCDA 0 0 ./data/data2 ./data/data2_reference_profiles
		"data2_reference_profiles" here is the file of reference profiles for the MCDA problem instance "data2"

For further explanations on how the application works, we have tried to provide concise comments in the sources : directories ./srcs/ and ./heads/
