I) The application is relatively easy to use and much easier for unix users with the Make tool available : the building process is performed by the Makefile and provides a ready for use executable. However the gcc compiler is required.
	- The "Make" command produces the executable "MCDA"
	- To run the application, a numerical instance of a MCDA problem is required as parameter (some instances are stored into the directory ./data/ ).
		eg : ./MCDA	data/data1
			
II)
  The format of the numerical instance is as follows :

_ 1st line : M K N, where M is the number of "experts", K the number of criteria and N the number of actions/alternatives.

_ K next lines : for each criterion, the thresholds q and p of the preferences sets.

_ (K+1)th line : the weights of the criteria (K floats or integers).

_ Remaining lines : By M groups of K+1 lines :
	* the first line gives the weight of the expert
	* the K next lines denote the score of the alternatives (actions, projects, etc.) on each criterion.

eg. :
2 2 3
1 2
2 3
1 1 1
3
4 5 5
5 6 7
3
1 2 3
4 6 7

(1st line) This instance illustrate a MC Problem evaluated by 2 experts, weighting on 2-criteria 3 projects.
(2nd line) The 1st criteria has an indifference and preference thresholds values of respectively 1 and 2.
(3rd line) The 2nd criteria has the thresholds values of 2 and 3.
(4th line) The weights of the criteria : 1 1 1 (all equals).
(5th line) The 1st expert has a weight of 3
(6th and 7th line) the 3 projects (a, b, c) are evaluated by the first expert as follows :
				a	|	b	|	c
	on 1st criteria : 	4	|	5	|	5
	on 2nd criteria :	5	|	6	|	7
(Next 2+1 lines) same for the 2nd expert.

III) The format of the outputs is as follows :
	- For each expert and
		-- for each criterion, the preference function (level criterion)
		-- the multicriteria preference indices,
		-- the flows,
		-- the binary preference relations :
			** N elements of the format (a,b,c), where a and b are the projetcs and c is the value of the binary relation :
				=> 3 for the preference relation : (a,b,3) a is preferred to b
				=> 2 for the preference relation : (a,b,2) a and b are indifferent ((b,a,2) should be too into the preference relation set.)
				=> 1 for the preference relation : (a,b,1) a and b are incomparable ((b,a,1) should be too into the preference relation set.)
		-- In case of a :
			--- Partial preorder (PROMETHEE I) : the weighted aggregation of the overall binary preference relations 
			--- Complete preorder (PROMETHEE II) : The complete ranking for each expert and the sum of ranks (the ranking over all the experts can then be done by a ranking from the lowest sum value to the highest.)


IV) We have tried to provide concise comments in the sources, directory ./srcs/ and ./heads/ .
