I) We have tried our best to provide concise comments onto the sources 

II) The format of the input data is as follows :

_ 1st line : M K N, where M is the number of "experts", K the number of criteria and N the number of actions/alternatives.

_ K next lines : for each criterion, the thresholds q and p of the preferences sets.

_ (K+1)th line : the weights of the criteria (K floats or integers).

_ Remaining lines : By M groups of K+1 lines :
	* the first line gives the weight of the expert
	* the K next lines denote the score of the alternatives (actions, projects, etc.) on each criterion.

eg. :
2 2 3
1 2
2 3
1 1 1
3
4 5 5
5 6 7
3
1 2 3
4 6 7

(1st line) This instance illustrate a MC Problem evaluated by 2 experts, weighting on 2-criteria 3 projects.
(2nd line) The 1st criteria has an indifference and preference thresholds values of respectively 1 and 2.
(3rd line) The 2nd criteria has the thresholds values of 2 and 3.
(4th line) The weights of the criteria : 1 1 1 (all equals).
(5th line) The 1st expert has a weight of 3
(6th and 7th line) the 3 projects (a, b, c) are evaluated by the first expert as follows :
				a	|	b	|	c
	on 1st criteria : 	4	|	5	|	5
	on 2nd criteria :	5	|	6	|	7
(Next 2+1 lines) same for the 2nd expert.
