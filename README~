The application is much more easier to compile with the Make tool : it does the whole building process and provides a complete, ready to use executable (the gcc compiler is also required) :
	- The "Make" command produces the executable "MCDA"
	- To run the application, a numerical instance of a MCDA problem (stochastic or deterministic) is required as parameter (some instances are present in the directory ./data/ ).
		* to apply PROMETHEE on the numerical instance given by "data1" file (into ./data/) with a deterministic method :
			./MCDA 0 ./data/data1
			The digit 0 tells the application to use PROMETHEE with a usual method.
	- To run the application using the EPF (Expected Preference Function), for a stochastic multicriteria problem whose joint distribution is not known, just change the digit provided as argument to 1 :
		./MCDA 1 ./data/data1
	- When the number of arguments provided to the executable is 2, the default operation applied is a ranking. To use the sorting method flowsort, provide as 3rd argument the reference profiles :
		./MCDA 1 ./data/data1 ./data/data_reference_profiles
		"data_reference_profiles" is a file of reference profiles 

For users with no "make" tool available, a solution could be to rebuild completely from the sources, or use the msys (http://www.mingw.org/) tool that provides all the necessary requirements (make and a gcc compiler).

For further  We have tried to provide concise comments in the sources, directory ./srcs/ and ./heads/ .
