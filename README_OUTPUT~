Two outputs are possible for a Multicriteria Problem numerical instance : The ranking result and the sorting result.

I) The result of the application of the PROMETHEE method (I or II). It is contained in a file named : ranking_[name_of_instance] in the "outputs" directory.
Its content : 

	- M time (for each expert) the following results :
		-- PI, the multicriteria preference function
		-- PHI, the outranking/outranked/net flows
		-- S_l, the binary preference relations set.
			** a number of elements of the format (a,b,c), where a and b are the projects and c is the value of the binary relation :
				=> 3 for the preference relation : (a,b,3) a is preferred to b
				=> 2 for the indifference relation : (a,b,2) a and b are indifferent ((b,a,2) should be too into the preference relation set.)
				=> 1 for the incomparability relation : (a,b,1) a and b are incomparable ((b,a,1) should be too into the preference relation set.)


	- In case of a :
		-- Partial preorder (PROMETHEE I) : the weighted aggregation of the overall binary preference relations.
		-- Complete preorder (PROMETHEE II) : The complete ranking for each expert and the sum of ranks over all the experts (the ranking over all the experts can then be done by a ranking from the lowest sum value to the highest.)

		
V) We have tried to provide concise comments in the sources, directory ./srcs/ and ./heads/ .
