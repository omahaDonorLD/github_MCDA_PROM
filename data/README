data are of the form :

1st line : M K N, where M is the number of "experts", K the number of criteria and N the number of actions/alternatives.

2nd line : the thresholds p and q for the preferences sets.

3rd line : the weights of the criteria.

Next lines : For M groups of K+1 lines, the first line gives the weight of the expert and the remaining lines express the score on each criterion.

eg :
3
1 2 3
4 5 5
5 6 7

This instance gives the data for a 2-criteria problem evaluated by 1 expert with 3 possible actions. The expert, who has got a weight of 3, marked the 3 projects noted a, b, c with :
			a	|	b	|	c
on 1st criteria : 	4	|	5	|	5
on 2nd criteria :	5	|	6	|	7
