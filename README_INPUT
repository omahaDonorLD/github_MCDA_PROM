The format of the numerical instance (For the ranking) is as follows :

I) Numerical instance of a MCDA Problem WHOSE JOINT DISTRIBUTION IS KNOWN :

_ 1st line : M K N : M is the number of "experts", K the number of criteria and N the number of actions/alternatives.

_ K next lines : for each criterion, the thresholds q and p of the preferences sets.

_ (K+1)th line : K floats : the weights of the criteria (K floats or integers).

_ Remaining lines : In M groups of K+1 lines :
	* the first line gives the weight of the expert
	* the K next lines denote the score of the alternatives (actions, projects, etc.) on each criterion.

eg. :
2 2 3
1 2
2 3
1 1 1
3
4 5 5
5 6 7
3
1 2 3
4 6 7

(1st line) This instance illustrates a 2-criteria (2nd value) Problem where 3 projects (3rd value) are evaluated by 2 experts (1st value).
(2nd line) The 1st criterion has indifference and preference threshold values of respectively 1 and 2.
(3rd line) The 2nd criterion has threshold values of 2 and 3.
(4th line) The weights of the criteria : 1 1 1 (all equals).
(5th line) The 1st expert has a weight of 3
(6th and 7th line) the 3 projects (a, b, c) are evaluated by the first expert as follows :
				a	|	b	|	c
	on 1st criteria : 	4	|	5	|	5
	on 2nd criteria :	5	|	6	|	7
(Next 2+1 lines) same for the 2nd expert.


II) Numerical instance of a MCDA Problem whose distribution function IS NOT known : The only difference is on the input of the evaluations. Since the normal distribution is used the input to provide for each evaluation is the mean and the standard deviation, each evaluation is composed of two values separated by a comma :
eg. :
2 2 3
1 2
2 3
1 1 1
3
4.9,2 5.,2 5.,2
5.,2.9 6.,2 7.,2
3
1,2.0 2,2.0 3.9,1.5
4.,2. 6,2.0 7,1.

Similar to the previous problem but with a stochastic feature : each evaluation has the "mean,standard deviation" parameters for the cumulated distribution function.

III) When one wants to apply a sorting method, he has to add a supplementary argument that is a file containing the reference profiles to apply to the sorting, in which the 1st line contains the number of profiles on each criterion.
eg. :
5
100 100 100 100 100
75 75 75 75 75
50 50 50 50 50
25 25 25 25 25
0 0 0 0 0

5 reference profiles for each criterion (5 criteria here).
